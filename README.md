## A note from the author

Hello! Im Elliott - thanks for looking this code over.

I am a junior engineer and have not worked with most of this tech before so I'm well aware there are probably some things that would make a senior dev weep.

As you can imagine, I have a few of these floating about and time to complete them needs to be shared. As a result of that, there are some time-saving decisions I made here and some other things I'd love to include - tests for example. As it stands this all works locally and its a good jumping off point for a discussion so I hope its ok on your end.

I've never used graphQL before and, annoyingly, the point at which I'd have asked for help would have been hooking up your sandbox to my project... I followed along with some docs and seeded some of my own data in order to overcome this block in the absence of someone who knows what they are doing better.

Thanks again,

Ell
